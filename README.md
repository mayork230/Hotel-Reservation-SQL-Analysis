# Hotel-Reservation-Analysis
Here are 15 questions you can explore with SQL queries to gain deeper understanding and actionable insights from the dataset.
# Overview
The hotel industry relies on data to make informed decisions and provide a better guest experience. In this project, I worked with a hotel reservation dataset to gain insights into guest preferences, booking trends, and other key factors that impact the hotel's operations. I used SQL to query and analyze the data, as well as answer specific questions about the dataset.
# Dataset Details
The dataset includes the following columns:

* Booking_ID: A unique identifier for each hotel reservation.
* no_of_adults: The number of adults in the reservation.
- no_of_children: The number of children in the reservation.
- no_of_weekend_nights: The number of nights in the reservation that fall on weekends.
* no_of_week_nights: The number of nights in the reservation that fall on weekdays.
* type_of_meal_plan: The meal plan chosen by the guests.
* room_type_reserved: The type of room reserved by the guests.
* lead_time: The number of days between booking and arrival.
* arrival_date: The date of arrival.
* market_segment_type: The market segment to which the reservation belongs.
* avg_price_per_room: The average price per room in the reservation.
* booking_status: The status of the booking.

# Project Tasks
I was tasked with analyzing this hotel reservation dataset using SQL. Here are 15 questions for which I wrote SQL queries to gain insights:

1. Total Number of Reservations: Determined the total number of reservations in the dataset.
2. Popular Meal Plan: Identified the most popular meal plan among guests.
3. Average Price for Reservations with Children: Calculated the average price per room for reservations involving children.
4. Yearly Reservations: Counted the number of reservations made for a specific year.
5. Common Room Type: Found the most commonly booked room type.
6. Weekend Reservations: Counted how many reservations fall on a weekend (no_of_weekend_nights > 0).
7. Lead Time Range: Identified the highest and lowest lead time for reservations.
8. Common Market Segment: Determined the most common market segment type for reservations.
9. Confirmed Reservations: Counted the number of reservations with a booking status of "Confirmed".
10. Total Adults and Children: Calculated the total number of adults and children across all reservations.
11. Average Weekend Nights with Children: Found the average number of weekend nights for reservations involving children.
12. Monthly Reservations: Counted how many reservations were made in each month of the year.
13. Average Nights by Room Type: Calculated the average number of nights (both weekend and weekday) spent by guests for each room type.
14. Common Room Type with Children: Determined the most common room type for reservations involving children, and the average price for that room type.
15. Highest Average Price by Market Segment: Found the market segment type that generates the highest average price per room.
